Ladderr is an online job portal which covering the island as the region. Vision of our website is to give opportunity to job seekers to find jobs and recruiters to reach a wider audience. However, our website gives opportunities to post remote jobs and to apply for them. We named our website as ‚ÄúLadderr‚Äù to indicates that this is a platform where every user can reach their dreams. Users of our website are recruiter, job seeker, administrator, moderator, and the guest.
<br><br>
Specialty of our website is that we allow our users to search jobs and company profiles before registering to the website. When a guest decides to register, we give just do not alone create account with an email and password but also let them choose between recruiter and job seeker and according to their choice we give them different pages to register with the input fields which are exclusively curated for their role.
<br><br>
After choosing the options they will direct to the registration form according to their choices. Registering to our website also includes agreeing to our terms and condition which are very transparent. If the registration is successful, user is officially part of our website and the email and password given in create account page will be the user‚Äôs login credential. After that, a profile will be automatically generated to the user. They can edit or delete the profile. If it is a recruiter‚Äôs profile, they can see their posted vacancies and relevant applicants. On the other hand, if it is a seeker‚Äôs profile, they can see their saved jobs and the applied jobs. 
<br><br>
For applied jobs, recruiter can approve or reject application. If the applicant is approved details regarding the interview will be forwarded to them via email by the recruiter. Else if the applicant is rejected, no email will be sent but the application status will be shown to the seeker alone. Which we, the developing team thinks that it saves lot of time of both seeker and recruiter. Furthermore, for job seekers they can sort top jobs, freelance jobs, part time jobs, full time jobs, remote jobs and so on. 
<br><br>
We designed our website to bring the best experience to our users by providing exclusive functionalities and removing constrains as much as possible.
